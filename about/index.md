I'm Korean Developer. My name is Ahn, Hyoung-woo.

I graduated department of Korean language education. After graduate, I have gotten a job at [&lt;Workers Solidarity>](http://wspaper.org)([page Google translated](https://translate.google.co.kr/translate?sl=ko&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=ko&ie=UTF-8&u=wspaper.org&edit-text=&act=url)) that is a far-left media. There were not many people, but we needed a webmaster. That is the reason why I learned web develop, and became do it somehow.

This blog is to share what I learned(Originally, [I have wrote by Hangul Korean Character](http://mytory.net). This blog is translating blog). Because I’ve taught from other blogs too. My English skill is poor, but I want to help other developer.

End.
