I&#8217;m Korean Developer. My name is Ahn, Hyoung-woo.

I graduated department of Korean language education. After graduate, I have gotten a job at <LEFT21> that is a far-left media. There were not many people, but they needed a webmaster. That is the reason why I learned web development, and became do it somehow.

This blog is to share what I learned. Because I’ve taught from other blogs too. My English skill is poor, but my code skill is not bad. So I want to help other developer.

End.
