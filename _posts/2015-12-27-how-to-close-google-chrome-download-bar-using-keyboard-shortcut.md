summery: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd>.

I mainly use keyboard on web surfing. It may be just my finger, index finger joint ache when I use mouse long time. So I use Chrome extension like [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) allow to surf the web without a mouse.

Chrome leaves download status bar after download complete. It is annoying. Of course It's good on downloading. But after download, I have to use a mouse to click `x` button to close the download status bar. I don't like to release my hand from keyboard.

I was looking for keyboard shortcut, and there was nothing good enough. [Always Clear Downloads extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/always-clear-downloads/cpbmgiffkljiglnpdbljhlenaikojapc) is not well for me. It made difficult to detect download complete because it auto clear the bar after five seconds.

[Macro for mac](http://rocketink.net/2013/06/close-google-chrome-downloads.html) is good. But I don't use a mac.

And then, I found it easier than expected. Method is that <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd>. Then, Chrome open download list tab and close download status bar. Wow~! Now, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> to close download list tab. You return to a tab you were.

Conclusion:

<pre>Ctrl + j, Ctrl + w</pre>

Good!
